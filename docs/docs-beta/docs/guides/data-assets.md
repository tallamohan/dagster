The most common way to create a data asset in Dagster is by annotating a function with an asset decorator. The function computes the contents of the asset, such as a database table or file.

Dagster supports several ways of creating assets, but this guide will focus on using Python decorators to define data assets.

## What you'll learn

- The asset decorators Dagster supports
- How to define a single asset
- How to define operations that create multiple assets
- How to define multiple operations that create a single asset

## Asset decorators

Dagster has four types of asset decorators:

| Decorator | Description |
|--------|---|
| `@asset` | Defines a single asset. [See an example](#single-asset). |
| `@multi_asset` | Outputs multiple assets from a single operation. [See an example](#multi-asset). |
| `@graph_asset` | Outputs a single asset from multiple operations without making each operation itself an asset. [See an example](#graph-asset). |
| `@graph_multi_asset` | Outputs multiple assets from multiple operations |

## Defining operations that create a single asset \{#single-asset}

The simplest way to define a data asset in Dagster is by using the `@asset` decorator. This decorator marks a Python function as an asset.

<CodeExample filePath="guides/data-assets/data-assets/asset_decorator.py" language="python" title="Using @dg.asset decorator" />

In this example, `my_data_asset` is an asset that logs its output. Dagster automatically tracks its dependencies and handles its execution within the pipeline.

## Defining operations that create multiple assets \{#multi-asset}

When you need to generate multiple assets from a single operation, you can use the `@multi_asset` decorator. This allows you to output multiple assets while maintaining a single processing function, which could be useful for:

- Making a single call to an API that updates multiple tables
- Using the same in-memory object to compute multiple assets

In this example, `my_multi_asset` produces two assets: `asset_one` and `asset_two`. Each is derived from the same function, which makes it easier to handle related data transformations together:

<CodeExample filePath="guides/data-assets/data-assets/multi_asset_decorator.py" language="python" title="Using @dg.multi_asset decorator" />

This example could be expressed as:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  multi(my_multi_asset) --> one(asset_one)
  multi(my_multi_asset) --> two(asset_two)
```

## Defining multiple operations that create a single asset \{#graph-asset}

For cases where you need to perform multiple operations to produce a single asset, you can use the `@graph_asset` decorator. This approach encapsulates a series of operations and exposes them as a single asset, allowing you to model complex pipelines while only exposing the final output.

<CodeExample filePath="guides/data-assets/data-assets/graph_asset_decorator.py" language="python" title="Using @dg.graph_asset decorator" />

In this example, `complex_asset` is an asset that's the result of two operations: `step_one` and `step_two`. These steps are combined into a single asset, abstracting away the intermediate representations.

This example could be expressed as:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  one((step_one)) --> asset(complex_asset)
  two((step_two)) --> asset(complex_asset)
```
